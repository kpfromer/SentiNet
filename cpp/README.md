## common
All interface header files and source code - these are abstract files that contain interface declerations - i.e. no implimentations yet, just common functions and data structures. The majority of kernelOPS is interface based and templated

## impl
All specific header files and implimentation source code - these are extensions of the interfaces found in common. An main.cpp is in the top source

## tests
source code and headers for tests. If tests are added in cmake arguments, all tests will be executed by default
