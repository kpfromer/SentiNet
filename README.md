# Documentation soon to come

For now, you can build the project like this

(Note, you need ZMQ built on your computer, I'm thinking about adding it as a library, but for now, 
 build it using the instructions (look up zmq and build instructions)

 ```bash
  # Target All builds code and removes cmake artifacts
 $ make

  # Target format code formats all code
 $ make format

  # Target clean cleans build directory
 $ make clean

 ```
