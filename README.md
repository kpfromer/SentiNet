# Documentation soon to come

For now, you can build the project like this

(Note, you need ZMQ built on your computer, I'm thinking about adding it as a library, but for now, 
 build it using the instructions (look up zmq and build instructions)

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

$ ./x86_64/bin/server
$ ./x86_64/bin/client #IN A SEPERATE TERMINAL
```
